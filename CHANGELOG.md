* [1.2.1](#1-2-1)
* [1.2.0](#1-2-0)


## Unreleased
### Added

* FreeBSD support
* User configurable key- and mouse bindings. See `man 5 foot` and the
  example `footrc` (https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/issues/1)
* **initial-window-mode** option to `footrc`, that lets you control
  the initial mode for each newly spawned window: _windowed_,
  _maximized_ or _fullscreen_.
* **app-id** option to `footrc` and `--app-id` command line option,
  that sets the _app-id_ property on the Wayland window.
* **title** option to `footrc` and `--title` command line option, that
  sets the initial window title.
* Right mouse button extends the current selection.
* `CSI Ps ; Ps ; Ps t` escape sequences for the following parameters:
  `11t`, `13t`, `13;2t`, `14t`, `14;2t`, `15t`, `19t`.
* Unicode combining characters. Parts of this feature are compile time
  optional. See [README.md](README.md#user-content-unicode-combining)
  for details.

### Changed

* Spaces no longer removed from zsh font name completions.
* Default key binding for _spawn-terminal_ to ctrl+shift+n.
* Renderer is now much faster with interactive scrolling
  (https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/issues/4)
* memfd sealing failures are no longer fatal errors.
* Selection to no longer be cleared on resize.
* The current monitor's subpixel order (RGB/BGR/V-RGB/V-BGR) is
  preferred over FontConfig's `rgba` property. Only if the monitor's
  subpixel order is `unknown` is FontConfig's `rgba` property used. If
  the subpixel order is `none`, then grayscale antialiasing is
  used. The subpixel order is ignored if antialiasing has been
  disabled.
* The four primary font variants (normal, bold, italic, bold italic)
  are now loaded in parallel. This speeds up both the initial startup
  time, as well as a DPI changes.


### Deprecated
### Removed

* Keyboard/pointer handler workarounds for Sway 1.2.


### Fixed

* Sixel images moved or deleted on window resize.
* Cursor sometimes incorrectly restored on exit from alternate screen.
* 'Underline' cursor being invisible on underlined text.
* Restored cursor position in 'normal' screen when window was resized
  while in 'alt' screen.
* Hostname in OSC 7 URI not being validated.
* OSC 4 with multiple `c;spec` pairs.
* Alt+Return to emit "ESC \r".
* Trackpad sloooow scrolling to eventually scroll a line.
* Memory leak in terminal reset.
* Translation of cursor coordinates on resize
* Scaling color specifiers in OSC sequences.
* `OSC 12 ?` to return the cursor color, not the cursor's text color.
* `OSC 12;#000000` to configure the cursor to use inverted
  foreground/background colors.


### Security


## 1.2.3

### Fixed
* Forgot to version bump 1.2.2


## 1.2.2

### Changed

* Changed icon name in `foot.desktop` and `foot-server.desktop` from
  _terminal_ to _utilities-terminal_.
* `XDG_SESSION_ID` is now included in the server/daemon default socket
  path.


### Fixed

* Window size doubling when moving window between outputs with
  different scaling factors (https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/issues/3).
* Font being too small on monitors with fractional scaling
  (https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/issues/5).


## 1.2.1

### Fixed

* Building AUR package


## 1.2.0

### Added

* Run-time text resize using ctrl-+, ctrl+- and ctrl+0
* Font size adjusts dynamically to outputs' DPI
* Reflow text when resizing window
* **pad** option to `footrc`
* **login-shell** option to `footrc` and `--login-shell` command line
  option
* Client side decorations (CSDs). This finally makes foot usable on
  GNOME.
* Sixel graphics support
* OSC 12 and 112 escape sequences (set/reset text cursor color)
* REP CSI escape sequence
* `oc` to terminfo
* foot-server.desktop file
* Window and cell size reporting escape sequences
* `--hold` command line option
* `--print-pid=FILE|FD` command line option


### Changed

* Subpixel antialiasing is only enabled when background is opaque
* Meta/alt ESC prefix can now be disabled with `\E[?1036l`. In this
  mode, the 8:th bit is set and the result is UTF-8 encoded. This can
  also be disabled with `\E[1024l` (in which case the Alt key is
  effectively being ignored).
* terminfo now uses ST instead of BEL as OSC terminator
* Logging to print to stderr, not stdout
* Backspace now emits DEL (^?), and ctrl+backspace emits BS (^H)


### Removed

* '28' from DA response
